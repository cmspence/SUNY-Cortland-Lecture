Python code for Lake Problem illustration in "Chemistry and the Environment" Oct. 16, 2017 guest lecture.

This includes a version of the (intertemporal) lake problem (Carpenter et al., 1999) with nonstationary natural phosphorous inputs. The re-designed problem was designed to introduce the issue of deep uncertainty associated with climate change.
